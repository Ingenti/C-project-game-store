# School-related-projects

I'm a biomedical engineering major at Aalto University.

While trying to learn Git and more about software development, I'm adding school related programming projects for both archiving and further development purposes.


This repo contains projects from three different courses I've taken:

1. oop with python ---> 	PyQt-numvis-project (numerical visualization)
2. oop with C++    ---> 	traffic-simulator-2019-C++
3. Basics of C 	   ---> 	C-project-game-store
